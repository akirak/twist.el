* Twist.el
Twist.el is an Emacs frontend to [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][Twist]], an alternative machinery for Nix that builds Emacs Lisp packages.
It lets you inspect (i.e. browse and review) packages in an Emacs configuration managed with Twist.

The goal of twist.el is as follows:

- Improve the user experiences of Twist. Help update packages securely but efficiently.
- Provide a nice feedback loop for quality checking of Emacs Lisp packages. A user of Twist can be both a package user and a developer at the same time.

Twist and twist.el constitute a package manager for Emacs.
It is an alternative to package.el, [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][borg]], etc.
Unlike those, Twist builds everything in Nix. It requires no runtime but Nix.

Twist is currently an alpha, so is Twist.el.
** Features
*** Encouraging a secure workflow while allowing maximum flexilibility
As a package manager, Twist is security-oriented in the following aspects:

- Twist locks every Emacs package in a lock file. Rather than update all packages at once, it is recommended to update individual packages, and Twist allows that. See [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/81jqim/emacs_packages_security/][why this is important]].
- Twist builds packages in a Nix sandbox. If there were some malicious code that is run during byte-compilation, it would probably fail because of its restrictions. The same can be said for build tasks for non-elisp code shipped with the package (e.g. dynamic modules).
- New packages won't be loaded until you start a new Emacs session or load/evaluate files manually. This is less interactive, but is more secure. For example, you could easily run static checkers on a produced artifact.

In short, Twist combines the flexibility of straight.el and simplicity of borg but delegates all the heavy-lifting to Nix. The core library of Twist is a re-implementation of [[https://github.com/melpa/package-build][package-build]] in Nix.
*** Inspecting from outside
In Twist, a configuration is a Nix flake package. Twist.el can open any configuration that is a local flake, so you can inspect a configuration from outside.
You can also browse a configuration of someone else without running it, if the configuration is in Twist.
It has a potential to become a tinkering tool.
*** Reusing a toolchain of Nix
The lock file format of Twist is =flake.lock=, which is becoming common in Nix communities.
Once we get an interactive Emacs frontend for updating =flake.lock=, you will be able to update packages in your Twist configuration efficiently.
Until then, you can use =nix flake lock= command.
** Screenshots

** Usage
Run =twist-connect= to open a flake package on your file system.
Use =twist-list-packages= to browse packages, and use =twist-describe-package= to view information of a package.

Edit your configuration, update the lock file, and run =twist-reload= to reflect changes.

Twist.el relies on a =nix repl= session, and many commands are flaky at the moment.
If it fails, you may get a successful result by running the same command again.
Twist.el only interacts with read-only APIs, so it is mostly safe what ever you do with it, as long as Nix is reliable.
*** Bookmark integration
Twist.el integrates with the default bookmark system of Emacs.
You can bookmark an Emacs configuration project, so you can check it later.
Bookmarks can be created when you are browsing a package list or displaying a package.
